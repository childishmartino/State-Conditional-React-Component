# State Conditional Component

## Description
Built a component that changes button options based off of state passed in. The first three buttons are not linked up, but the last button will toggle the state and change button color and options. I tweeted asking what were some exercises people recommended to be ready for a Front-End Technical interview, and this is one of the things that came back to me. 

## Check it out
You can take a look at the component via Netlify. I might have been thinking about dinner when working on this example.
